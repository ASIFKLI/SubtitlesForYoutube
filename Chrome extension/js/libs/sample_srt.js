00:00:01,342 --> 00:00:04,840
Look, I was gonna go easy on you and not to hurt your feelings

2
00:00:04,840 --> 00:00:11,555
But I'm only going to get this one chance
Something's wrong, I can feel it

3
00:00:11,555 --> 00:00:17,751
Just a feeling I've got, like something's about to happen, but I don't know what

4
00:00:17,751 --> 00:00:24,515
If that means, what I think it means, we're in trouble, big trouble, and if he is as bananas as you say, I'm not taking any chances

5
00:00:24,515 --> 00:00:26,088
You are just what the doc ordered

6
00:00:26,088 --> 00:00:27,456
I'm beginning to feel like a

7
00:00:27,456 --> 00:00:27,895
Rap

8
00:00:27,895 --> 00:00:28,378
God

9
00:00:28,378 --> 00:00:28,772
Rap

10
00:00:28,772 --> 00:00:29,230
God

11
00:00:29,230 --> 00:00:32,234
All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod

12
00:00:32,234 --> 00:00:35,515
Now who thinks their arms are long enough to slapbox, slapbox

13
00:00:35,515 --> 00:00:37,962
They said I rap like a robot, so call me rapbot

14
00:00:37,962 --> 00:00:40,172
But for me to rap like a computer must be in my genes

15
00:00:40,172 --> 00:00:43,570
I got a laptop in my back pocket , My pen'll go off when I half-cock it

16
00:00:43,570 --> 00:00:46,441
Got a fat knot from that rap profit ,Made a living and a killing off it

17
00:00:46,441 --> 00:00:49,999
Ever since Bill Clinton was still in office , With Monica Lewinsky feeling on his nut-sack

18
00:00:49,999 --> 00:00:52,909
I'm an MC still as honest ,But as rude and as indecent as all hell

19
00:00:52,909 --> 00:00:55,986
Syllables, killaholic (kill em all with) , This slickety, gibbedy, hibbedy hip-hop

20
00:00:55,986 --> 00:00:58,120
You don't really wanna get into a pissing match with this rappidy rap

21
00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:02,293
Packing a Mac in the back of the Ac, backpack rap crap, yep, yep, yackity-yak. Now at the exact same time

22
00:01:02,293 --> 00:01:04,601
I attempt these lyrical acrobat stunts while I'm practicing that

23
00:01:04,601 --> 00:01:06,063
I'll still be able to break a motherfuckin' table

24
00:01:06,063 --> 00:01:07,972
Over the back of a couple of faggots and crack it in half

25
00:01:07,972 --> 00:01:11,488
Only realized it was ironic I was signed to Aftermath after the fact

26
00:01:11,488 --> 00:01:14,430
How could I not blow, all I do is drop F-bombs, feel my wrath of attack

27
00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:16,987
Rappers are having a rough time period, here's a maxi pad

28
00:01:16,987 --> 00:01:21,410
It's actually disastrously bad for the wack
While I'm masterfully constructing this masterpiece as

29
00:01:21,410 --> 00:01:22,610
I'm beginning to feel like a

30
00:01:22,610 --> 00:01:23,090
Rap

31
00:01:23,090 --> 00:01:23,539
God

32
00:01:23,539 --> 00:01:23,951
Rap

33
00:01:23,951 --> 00:01:24,354
God

34
00:01:24,354 --> 00:01:27,418
All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod

35
00:01:27,418 --> 00:01:30,554
Now who thinks their arms are long enough to slapbox, slapbox

36
00:01:30,554 --> 00:01:33,875
Let me show you maintaining this shit ain't that hard, that hard

37
00:01:33,875 --> 00:01:37,222
Everybody want the key and the secret to rap immortality like I have got

38
00:01:37,222 --> 00:01:39,911
Well, to be truthful the blueprint's simply rage and youthful exuberance

39
00:01:39,911 --> 00:01:41,512
Everybody loves to root for a nuisance

40
00:01:41,512 --> 00:01:44,351
Hit the earth like an asteroid, did nothing but shoot for the moon since

41
00:01:44,351 --> 00:01:48,319
MC's get taken to school with this music
Cause I use it as a vehicle to bust a rhyme

42
00:01:48,319 --> 00:01:52,886
Now I lead a new school full of students
Me, I'm a product of Rakim, Lakim Shabazz, 2Pac N

43
00:01:52,886 --> 00:01:56,125
W.A, Cube, Hey Doc, Ren Yella, Eazy, thank you, they got Slim

44
00:01:56,125 --> 00:01:59,185
Inspired enough to one day grow up, blow up and be in a position

45
00:01:59,185 --> 00:02:03,605
To meet Run DMC, induct them into the motherfuckin' Rock n' Roll Hall of Fame

46
00:02:03,605 --> 00:02:05,917
Even though I walk in the church and burst in a ball of flames

47
00:02:05,917 --> 00:02:08,671
Only Hall of Fame I be inducted in is the alcohol of fame

48
00:02:08,671 --> 00:02:13,454
On the wall of shame
You fags think it's all a game 'til I walk a flock of flames

49
00:02:13,454 --> 00:02:16,066
Off a plank, and tell me what in the fuck are you thinking

50
00:02:16,066 --> 00:02:17,100
Little gay lookin' boy

51
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:19,355
So gay I can barely say it with a straight face lookin', boy

52
00:02:19,355 --> 00:02:23,143
You witnessing a massacre
Like you watching a church gathering take place, lookin' boy

53
00:02:23,143 --> 00:02:25,813
Oy vey, that boy's gay, that's all they say looking, boy

54
00:02:25,813 --> 00:02:29,020
You get a thumbs up, pat on the back
And a way to go from your label everyday lookin', boy

55
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:32,342
Hey, lookin' boy, what you say lookin' boy
I get a "hell yeah" from Dre lookin', boy

56
00:02:32,342 --> 00:02:35,623
I'ma work for everything I have
Never ask nobody for shit, get outta my face lookin' boy

57
00:02:35,623 --> 00:02:38,820
Basically boy you're never gonna be capable
To keeping up with the same pace lookin', boy

58
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:40,492
I'm beginning to feel like a

59
00:02:40,492 --> 00:02:40,978
Rap

60
00:02:40,978 --> 00:02:41,375
God

61
00:02:41,375 --> 00:02:41,823
Rap

62
00:02:41,823 --> 00:02:42,224
God

63
00:02:42,224 --> 00:02:45,177
All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod

64
00:02:45,177 --> 00:02:48,487
The way I'm racing around the track, call me Nascar, Nascar

65
00:02:48,487 --> 00:02:51,103
Dale Earnhardt of the trailer park, the White Trash God

66
00:02:51,103 --> 00:02:54,973
Kneel before General Zod this planet's Krypton, no Asgard, Asgard

67
00:02:54,973 --> 00:02:58,734
So you be Thor and I'll be Odin, you rodent, I'm omnipotent

68
00:02:58,734 --> 00:03:02,000
Let off then I'm reloading immediately with these bombs I'm totin'

69
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,466
And I should not be woken

70
00:03:03,466 --> 00:03:06,663
I'm the walking dead, but I'm just a talking head, a zombie floating

71
00:03:06,663 --> 00:03:11,492
But I got your mom deep throating
I'm out my ramen noodle, we have nothing in common, poodle

72
00:03:11,492 --> 00:03:14,723
I'm a doberman, pinch yourself in the arm and pay homage, pupil

73
00:03:14,723 --> 00:03:17,280
It's me, my honesty's brutal

74
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:20,460
But it's honestly futile if I don't utilize what I do though

75
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:21,861
For good at least once in a while

76
00:03:21,861 --> 00:03:24,330
So I wanna make sure somewhere in this chicken scratch I scribble and doodle

77
00:03:24,330 --> 00:03:27,537
Enough rhymes to maybe try to help get some people through tough times

78
00:03:27,537 --> 00:03:30,608
But I gotta keep a few punchlines just in case cause even you unsigned

79
00:03:30,608 --> 00:03:35,748
Rappers are hungry looking at me like it's lunchtime
I know there was a time where once I Was king of the underground

80
00:03:35,748 --> 00:03:40,306
But I still rap like I'm on my Pharoahe Monch grind
So I crunch rhymes, but sometimes when you combine

81
00:03:40,306 --> 00:03:44,218
Appeal with the skin color of mine
You get too big and here they come trying to censor you

82
00:03:44,218 --> 00:03:47,297
Like that one line I said on "I'm Back" from the Mathers LP1

83
00:03:47,297 --> 00:03:50,305
Where I tried to say I take seven kids from Columbine

84
00:03:50,305 --> 00:03:53,823
Put em all in a line, add an AK-47, a revolver and a nine

85
00:03:53,823 --> 00:03:56,353
See if I get away with it now that I ain't as big as I was

86
00:03:56,353 --> 00:03:59,586
But I've morphed into an immortal coming through the portal

87
00:03:59,586 --> 00:04:01,790
You're stuck in a time warp from 2004 though

88
00:04:01,790 --> 00:04:06,676
And I don't know what the fuck that you rhyme for
You're pointless as Rapunzel with fuckin' cornrows

89
00:04:06,676 --> 00:04:10,316
You're like normal, fuck being normal
And I just bought a new ray gun from the future

90
00:04:10,316 --> 00:04:12,853
To just come and shoot ya like when Fabolous made Ray J mad

91
00:04:12,853 --> 00:04:14,860
Cause Fab said he looked like a fag at MayweatherÂ’s pad

92
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:19,481
Singin' to a man while they played piano
Man, oh man, that was a 24/7 special on the cable channel

93
00:04:19,481 --> 00:04:23,625
So Ray J went straight to the radio station the very next day. Hey Fab, I'mma kill you

94
00:04:23,625 --> 00:04:27,528
Lyrics coming at you at supersonic speed, (JJ Fad)
Uh, sama lamaa duma lamaa you assuming I'm a human

95
00:04:27,528 --> 00:04:29,107
What I gotta do to get it through to you I'm superhuman

96
00:04:29,107 --> 00:04:32,337
Innovative and I'm made of rubber
So that anything you say is ricocheting off of me and it'll glue to you

97
00:04:32,337 --> 00:04:33,781
I'm devastating, more than ever demonstrating

98
00:04:33,781 --> 00:04:35,776
How to give a motherfuckin' audience a feeling like it's levitating

99
00:04:35,776 --> 00:04:37,347
Never fading, and I know the haters are forever waiting

100
00:04:37,347 --> 00:04:38,956
For the day that they can say I fell off, they'd be celebrating

101
00:04:38,956 --> 00:04:40,221
Cause I know the way to get 'em motivated

102
00:04:40,221 --> 00:04:43,472
I make elevating music, you make elevator music
Oh, he's too mainstream

103
00:04:43,472 --> 00:04:45,417
Well, that's what they do when they get jealous, they confuse it

104
00:04:45,417 --> 00:04:48,574
It's not hip hop, it's pop, cause I found a hella way to fuse it

105
00:04:48,574 --> 00:04:51,797
With rock, shock rap with Doc
Throw on Lose Yourself and make 'em lose it

106
00:04:51,797 --> 00:04:55,270
I don't know how to make songs like that
I don't know what words to use

107
00:04:55,270 --> 00:04:58,234
Let me know when it occurs to you
While IÂ’m ripping any one of these verses, that versus you

108
00:04:58,234 --> 00:05:01,618
ItÂ’s curtains, IÂ’m inadvertently hurtin' you
How many verses I gotta murder to prove

109
00:05:01,618 --> 00:05:07,138
That if you were half as nice at songs, you can sacrifice virgins too. School flunkie, pill junky

110
00:05:07,138 --> 00:05:11,448
But look at the accolades these skills brung me
Full of myself, but still hungry

111
00:05:11,448 --> 00:05:14,369
I bully myself cause I make me do what I put my mind to

112
00:05:14,369 --> 00:05:17,922
And I'm a million leagues above you, ill when I speak in tongues

113
00:05:17,922 --> 00:05:22,982
But it's still tongue in cheek, fuck you
I'm drunk so Satan take the fucking wheel, I'm asleep in the front seat

114
00:05:22,982 --> 00:05:29,822
Bumpin' Heavy D and the Boys, still chunky but funky
But in my head there's something I can feel tugging and struggling

115
00:05:29,822 --> 00:05:33,135
Angels fight with devils and here's what they want from me

116
00:05:33,135 --> 00:05:35,010
They're asking me to eliminate some of the women hate

117
00:05:35,010 --> 00:05:37,064
But if you take into consideration the bitter hatred I had

118
00:05:37,064 --> 00:05:39,878
Then you may be a little patient and more sympathetic to the situation

119
00:05:39,878 --> 00:05:44,964
And understand the discrimination
But fuck it, life's handin' you lemons, make lemonade then

120
00:05:44,964 --> 00:05:49,698
But if I can't batter the women how the fuck am I supposed to bake them a cake then
Don't mistake it for Satan

121
00:05:49,698 --> 00:05:53,688
It's a fatal mistake if you think I need to be overseas
And take a vacation to trip abroad

122
00:05:53,688 --> 00:05:56,263
And make her fall on her face and don't be a retard

123
00:05:56,263 --> 00:05:57,755
Be a king, think not -

124
00:05:57,755 --> 00:05:59,413
Why be a king

125
00:05:59,413 --> 00:06:00,892
When you can be a God
`
