SubtitlesForYoutube
===================

This extension lets you add subtitles to any video you are watching on YouTube. Just drag and drop .SRT file or zipped .SRT file for your movie on to the video and the subtitles will start showing up.

The extension also supports searching and using subtitles directly from OpenSubtitles.org. Currently you can search subtitles in English and Spanish. I will be adding support for more languages soon.

Keyboard Shortcuts:

'V' - Enable/Disable subtitles

'G' - Precede subtitles relative to video

'H' - Delay subtitles relative to video

'Q' - Decrease subtitles size

'W' - Increase subtitles size
